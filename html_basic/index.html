            <h1>Freedom tied with a bow</h1>
            <p>Brutally knowing, growing up comes with a lot of change .Hard it is to try and disentangle yourself from the little you yet being drawn right back like a dog on aleash .I'm perpetually stuck in the moment.</p>
            <h2>Anxiously awaiting the age of assurance</h2>
            <p>What if I'm not strong enough for what's ahead . I have lost control and every emotion assaults me .How badly I wanted to turn 20 seeinf 'worthwhile' written in everything</p>
            <h3>Organised Chaos of my mind </h3>
            <p>My outlook has proved to be very different .Thoghts never straight coming in so unexpectedly in knotted loops curling in upon themselves!!</p>
